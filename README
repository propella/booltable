Boolean logic is a basic knowledge for all programmers. The idea is
very simple and straightforward, yet still it often annoys you a
lot. One of the reasons might be that boolean logic is not continuous
behavior, and just a bit of changes makes completely different
result. This is why it is hard to grab whole character of a boolean
expression, I think.

This tiny program shows every possible state of a boolean expression
to make sure your logic is correct. I wrote this to help me reading a
textbook about logic, and to make programming nested condition
statements easy.

One nice thing is "permlink" function. You can bookmark your favorite
boolean expressions to play again. It works even in file URL as this
is written entirely in Javascript. So feel free to download to your
local disk.

It was tested by Safari 4, FireFox 3, and InternetExplorer 7.

To run unit tests, remove comment for this line:
<!-- input type="button" name="test" value="test" onclick="runtest('');" -->
